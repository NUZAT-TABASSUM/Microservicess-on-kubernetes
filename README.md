# Implement a scalable microservices architecture on Kubernetes using Kubeadm 

This is a microservice application built using Flask for web services and MongoDB for scalable data storage. This project enables seamless development, deployment, and scaling of microservices in a containerized environment.


## Project Details 
1. Set up Kubeadm cluster on master and worker node.
2. Deploy microservices using Flask API
3. Integrate MongoDB for data storage by creating PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim.
4. Test the service through Postman


## Achievement

This contributes to a 40% increase in overall system scalability as the application can seamlessly grow to accommodate higher demand.
